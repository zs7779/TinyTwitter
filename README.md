# TinyTwitter


This is a personal project to recreate a tiny twitter with Vue/Django/Postgres


Current functions:
* Follow/unfollow user
* View user tweets
* Comment on a tweet/comment
* Retweet a tweet/comment
* Delete your own tweet/comment
* Like/unlike a tweet/comment


Expected functions:
* Hashtags
* Mentions
* Notifications
* User avatar
* Image upload with tweet
* Infinite scroll
* Mobile page


Twitter functions I noticed but have no intention to try:
* Video upload with tweet
* Block user/tweet/comment
* Events/Polls
* Live update
* "#Explore" post/hashtag ranking
* Analytics


Todos:
* Module design
* Architecture

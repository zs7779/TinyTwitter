This is a personal project using Vue/Django/PostgreSQL, recreating some of Twitter's interesting features. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Sass, Vue.js, Webpack, Django, PostgreSQL. Deployed on AWS EC2 using Nginx and Gunicorn.

If you'd like to run this code on your computer, clone this repository, and go to it in the command line `cd <repository path>`.  
I recommend using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to test run this code. If you decided to use Docker, use the following commands to get the site running:
```
docker build -t tinytwitter .
docker run -dp 8000:8000 tinytwitter
```
Now go to http://localhost:8000/ to check out the website running on your computer!


Alternatively you don't have to use Docker, but you do need to first install [Python3.8.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/) ([Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) strongly recommended if you already have Python on your computer). Set up the site by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Known issues:
* Infinite scroll sometimes not working on short screen (narrow screen landscape orientation)
* Scroll position not persisted when clicking on a post then go back
* Images uploads do not work if you run this code locally. It is because images are hosted on AWS S3 and need special permission.

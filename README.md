# TinyTwitter


This is a personal project with Vue/Django/Postgres, trying to reacreate some of Twitter's interesting functions


Current functions:
* Follow/unfollow user
* View user tweets
* Comment on a tweet/comment
* Retweet a tweet/comment
* Delete your own tweet/comment
* Like/unlike a tweet/comment
* Mentions
* Infinite scroll


Expected functions:
* Hashtags
* Notifications
* User avatar
* Image upload with tweet
* Mobile page


Twitter functions I noticed but currently have no intention to try:
* Video upload with tweet
* Block user/tweet/comment
* Share
* Events/Polls/Emojis
* Live update
* "#Explore" post/hashtag ranking
* Analytics


Known bugs:
* Infinite scroll not working on super small screen
* Scroll position not persisted when clicking on a post then go back


Todos:
* Architecture

# TinyTwitter


This is a personal project with Vue/Django, trying to recreate some of Twitter's interesting functions. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Sass, Vue.js, Webpack, Django, PostgreSQL. Deployed on AWS EC2 using Nginx and Gunicorn.  
Test data generated by https://mockaroo.com/

If you'd like to run this code on your machine, clone this directory (check out the green "Code" button), and go to it in the command line `cd <repository path>`.  
I recommend using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to test run this code. If you decided to use docker, running the following commands to get the site running
```
docker build -t tinytwitter .
docker run -dp 8000:8000 tinytwitter
```
Now go to http://localhost:8000/ to check out the website running on your computer!


Alternatively we don't have to use docker, you would need to first install Python3.8.6. ([virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) strongly recommended if you already have Python on your computer) set up the site by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
